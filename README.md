# A Template for Tauri + Leptos (+ Leptos Router) + TailWindCSS (+ [Cattpuccin](https://catppuccin.ryanccn.dev/))

This is a basic template for starting your leptos projects whilst utilizing tailwind css.
This template utilizes a trunk hook to compile your tailwindcss output into styles.css.
Please modify the Trunk.toml file to adjust the hook if you are not on nushell (pretty much uncommenting).
